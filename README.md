Through chatbots one can communicate with text or voice interface and get reply through artificial intelligence

Typically, a chat bot will communicate with a real person. 
Chat bots are used in applications such as 

1. E-commerce customer service,
2. Call centres, 
3. Internet gaming. 

Chatbots are programs built to automatically engage with received messages. Chatbots can be programmed to respond the same way each time, to respond differently to messages containing certain keywords and even to use machine learning to adapt their responses to fit the situation. 
A developing number of hospitals, nursing homes, and even private centres, presently utilize online Chatbots for human services on their sites. These bots connect with potential patients visiting the site, helping them discover specialists, booking their appointments, and getting them access to the correct treatment.
